Project: Futbol

Group Member Names: Jake Heft, Joshua Carey, Hope Gochnour, Will Dunlap

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):

- Jake: Get better at planning a project (grow in project organization skills) and refine GH workflow.
- Hope: Get better at handling how files are read from and how to work in a group.
- Joshua: Get better at approaching project with big picture in mind.
- Will: Learn effective ways of how to break up the project that saves time and makes coding more efficient. Growing in articulating thoughts/ideas before execution.
- Project Driver: getting better and learning new stuff.

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):

- Jake: Would like to see a mix of both individual and collaborative coding.
- Joshua: Preference towards independent work in terms of creativity.
- Will: Most efficient as independent worker and with intermittent breaks.
- Hope: Preference for mix of independent and direct collaboration. As needed, pair off or
- work together as a group. Outside of call check-ins, independent or pair up if needed.

<!-- How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles: -->
Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):

- Hope: Friday night commitments and Sunday night commitments.
- Jake: 1st and 2nd Saturday commitments. Ideally finish around 8 and 9, but week is open.
- Joshua: 1st weekend gone and open 2nd except Sundays 4 to 8 pm.
- Will: Flexible weekend commitments. Tuesdays (4-6 commitment but flexible)
- During weeK: Stop around 9 or 10 pm each night.
- Keep 5 to 7pm open for a zoom-like study hall.
- Have at least one zoom check-in per day (usually during )

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):

- Zoom:
- Slack: open communication through slack channel
- GoogleDoc: Hope will start a GoogleDoc for project question organization
- GitHub: comments on PRs and responses  

  *Make sure everyone is tracking; no dumb questions*
  *Get in the habit of providing and receiving feedback in GH comments*
  *In check-ins, have a quick touch point about how communication and project is going.*

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

- Jake has a little experience with front-end coding; can help direct preparation for iteration 4.
- Hope is more practiced with mocks and stubs and using project board.

  *Team growth expectations: comfort using mocks and stubs and front-end.*  

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

- Delegate work through project board on GitHub
- Even distribution as much as possible


Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):

1) Create work branch, work, commit regularly, push branch when finished, submit PR when working branch finished
2) A minimum of 2 people look at/comment on PR before merging
  *Send out slack message when submit a PR*
  *Utilize github slackbot to send automatic updates*
  *Respond to PR before next scheduled meetup.*

Pomodoro Break Schedule:
- Try to take break every 30 minutes (on the half-hour)
- Put off break if mutually agreed upon

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:

- Keep professional, kind, constructive, and prompt/timely.

Additional Remote Considerations:

 - We're always REMOTE.

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):
- Kanban for task management
